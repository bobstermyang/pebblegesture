# pebblegesture.js

This is a library which helps developers implement gesture control into javascript applications using the Pebble smart watch and pebble.js.

## Pebble Rocks Boulder

We used the pebblegesture library to create a pebble app called Greet (https://github.com/bobstermyang/greet/).

This app recognizes gestures such as shaking hands, giving high fives, fist bumps, and waves as positive human interaction. Then once a predefined gesture is triggered, it logs it as 1 interaction.
